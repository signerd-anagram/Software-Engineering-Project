# Software-Engineering-Project
APOLOGY:
Sorry my code is a little untidy. As the deadline for the project drew closer I became more untidy and ignored PEP8 guidelines. I PROMISE to come back to this code and right my wrong. Promise

I am still working on:
adding functionality to allow users to upload profile pics
adding functionality to allow users to upload scanned copies of their IDs for viewing by the admin
user profiles to allow users to manage their accounts
adding flash messages to communicate with the user


the admin login details are:
username: admin
password: admin

create a user account and explore. Don't forget to tell me what you think
